# Anti-ai-Dectection
This code allows you to bypass ai checks making your essay look like it was from a human

an advanced script that can detect if an essay is AI-generated and make it more human-like and original if necessary. This script utilizes natural language processing techniques and can be implemented using Python 

In this script, the is_ai_generated function checks if the essay contains patterns commonly found in AI-generated content. If such patterns are detected, the essay is considered AI-generated. 

The `make_human_like` function tokenizes the essay, performs part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatizes the tokens to their base form using WordNet. This step helps in making the text more human-like by reducing the complexity and variability of the words used.

The `improve_originality` function uses sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the essay. If the sentiment is negative, it replaces some words with their synonyms to enhance the originality of the content. This step aims to avoid repetitive or clich√©d language.

Finally, the `process_essay` function integrates all the steps. If the essay is identified as AI-generated, it first applies the `make_human_like` function to make it more human-like and then applies `improve_originality` to enhance its originality. The processed essay is returned as the output.

You can use this script as a starting point and customize it further based on your specific requirements or preferences.

an advanced script that can detect if an essay has been generated by an AI and then modifies it to make it 100 percent original, ensuring it passes an AI test:



    

        


In this script, we have two main functions. The `is_ai_generated` function sends the essay to an AI detection API endpoint, which returns a response indicating whether the essay was generated by AI. The `modify_essay` function takes the original essay and applies a modification algorithm to make it original.

In the example usage, we check if the essay is AI-generated using the `is_ai_generated` function. If it is, we pass the essay to the `modify_essay` function to make it original. Finally, we print the modified essay or the original essay based on the AI detection result.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you would need to implement the `modify_essay` function according to your specific requirements and modifications algorithm. Additionally, you would need to replace the API endpoint and handle error cases appropriately for the AI detection API.
