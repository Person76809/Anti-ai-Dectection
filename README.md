# Anti-ai-Dectection
This code allows you to bypass ai checks making your essay look like it was from a human

an advanced script that can detect if an essay is AI-generated and make it more human-like and original if necessary. This script utilizes natural language processing techniques and can be implemented using Python 

In this script, the is_ai_generated function checks if the essay contains patterns commonly found in AI-generated content. If such patterns are detected, the essay is considered AI-generated. 

The `make_human_like` function tokenizes the essay, performs part-of-speech tagging, and lemmatizes the tokens to their base form using WordNet. This step helps in making the text more human-like by reducing the complexity and variability of the words used.

The `improve_originality` function uses sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment of the essay. If the sentiment is negative, it replaces some words with their synonyms to enhance the originality of the content. This step aims to avoid repetitive or clich√©d language.

Finally, the `process_essay` function integrates all the steps. If the essay is identified as AI-generated, it first applies the `make_human_like` function to make it more human-like and then applies `improve_originality` to enhance its originality. The processed essay is returned as the output.

You can use this script as a starting point and customize it further based on your specific requirements or preferences.
